🚀 Features
Load and use a pre-trained LogisticRegression model for classifying transactions.

Preprocessing pipeline likely includes:

Text feature extraction (e.g., from transaction descriptions)

Encoding categorical variables

Normalization/scaling

Example transaction data usage

Inference and prediction


🛠 Requirements
Install the dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
If you're using the notebook:
pip install jupyter
📈 Usage
1. Launch the Notebook
jupyter notebook trans_categorization.ipynb
2. Use the Model
The notebook shows:

How to load the trained_logisticRegressionModel.pkl file

How to preprocess new transaction data

How to make predictions

3. Example Code Snippet

import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the model
model = joblib.load("trained_logisticRegressionModel.pkl")

# Load your transaction data
df = pd.read_csv("your_transactions.csv")

# Preprocess as shown in the notebook...

# Predict
predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_data)
